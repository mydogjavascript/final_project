# Technology Plan

## Data Cleaning and Analysis

Numpy and Pandas Profile will be used to finalize our decision on which dataset to use.  Pandas will also be used to clean the data and perform exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage

SQLite is the database we intend to use.

## Machine Learning

Jupyter Notbook, Google Colab, and SciKitLearn will be used to run ML.

## Dashboard

We plan to use html/JavaScript/D3 to create our Dashboard.

## Visualizations

We plan to use MatPlotLib and D3 to create visualizations in html.

## Additional modalities

- Slack- communication
