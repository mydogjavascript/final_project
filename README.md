## Communication protocol

#### Team JavaScript will communicate through our JavaScript Team channel. We anticipate working collaboratively throughtout the project duration providing support in our strengths and requesting support in our weaknesses.

#### Team JavaScript plans to use class sessions to collaborate along with using office hours and tutoring to guide through the project in its entirety.

## Data Choice

#### Team JavaScript wanted to work with data that was relevent to anyone. Crash data is relevant to any driver, any parent with children who have earned their driver license, and anyone who uses public roadways. This data included factors we had a general interest in to include age and sex of injured individual, airbag deployment, seatbelt usage, and year of vehicle. This data allows us to learn more about crash safety. We are also looking forward to making connections to injury severity and vehicle specifications and driver/passenger attributes.
